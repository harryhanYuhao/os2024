# Set up for dice Machine UoE

To set up environment, clone the repo and run

```bash
source init.bash
```

Now you should have a better terminal prompt and you can run:

```bash
killqemu # kill the running qemu. Does not work if more than one is running
cddisk # go to your /disk/scratch folder
c # clear the terminal
```
